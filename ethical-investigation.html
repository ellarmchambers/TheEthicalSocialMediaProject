            <p>Nowadays with technology on the rise and phones becoming a larger part of day-to-day life there are a large variety of applications available to users. Social media applications are extremely popular with “at least 3.5 billion” (Ortiz-Ospina, 2019) people online and “one-in-three people in the world” using social media platforms.
