                <p>Some social media applications encourage their users to stay connected through ‘liking’ and
                    ‘commenting’ on posts and ‘following’ others. Although these features were created to allow users to
                    connect with one another they have a dark side. When we receive a ‘like’ or new ‘follower’, feel
                    good chemicals such as dopamine are released creating an addictive nature. You may not know it, but
                    you might be posting images with the hope of receiving ‘likes’ and gratification from others.</p>

                        <p>The public nature of ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ can often lead to people comparing themselves to
                            others, having a detrimental effect on mental health. To combat the problematic nature of
                            these features the numbers associated with them should be removed from the main feed. A user
                            should be able to privately see how many ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ they have, but this
                            information does not need to be public on personal accounts</p>

                        <h2>Follower Count</h2>
                        <p>On Instagram, the quantity of followers is public, this can result in users comparing the
                            number of followers they have in relation to others. This could be solved by removing these
                            numbers on personal profiles, a user could see how many followers they had but anyone
                            visiting their profile would be unaware, this would remove the ability to compare accounts
                            and would reduce the negative effect that it has on mental health. </p>

                        <h2>Symbolism of Likes</h2>
                        <p>On Instagram ‘likes’ are symbolised through the use of a heart, the powerful and strong
                            emotions that are symbolised through the shape deepen the urge to receive ‘likes’ from
                            others. This problematic feature could be solved by providing the user with a range of
                            symbols that can be used to interact with a post. The term ‘like’ could then be removed and
                            replaced with ‘reaction’. A user would then get a variety of ‘reactions’ to their image
                            instead of a number of ‘likes’.</p>
